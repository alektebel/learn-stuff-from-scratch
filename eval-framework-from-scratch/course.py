"""Eval Framework From Scratch — course manifest.

Ten graded stages that build the RUNNER of an eval framework: the machine that
runs other people's code and other people's judgements and then has to say
something true about them. The task set, the solvers, the judges and the clock
are provided (`lab.py`); the exercise is everything that decides whether the
numbers mean anything — a suite config that refuses a typo instead of running
differently from what its author believed, metrics resolved as plugins before the
first call, one record per case from the position the case was actually in,
budgets that stop a call instead of reporting one, an aggregation whose unit is
the case and not the line, a judge that is cached, budgeted and order-blind,
records whose bytes two runs share, a gate that refuses to pass what it cannot
evaluate, a baseline diff that only cries regression when the difference beats
the noise, and a resume that leaves behind the log of an uninterrupted run.

This is the framework half of phase C1's lesson: `evals-from-scratch` owns what
to measure (EM, token F1, nDCG, judge bias, kappa, significance); this course owns
the machine those metrics live in, which is where the quiet failures are — the
run that recorded a case that never happened, the mean over lines instead of
cases, the cached judge verdict that leaked across a suite, the corpus that
entered the aggregate as a zero, the resume that bought itself a new budget.

No network, no wall clock, no uuid, no global state: the clock is `lab.Ticker`,
every float that lands in a record is rounded to `METRIC_DP`, and two runs of the
same suite produce byte-identical logs.
