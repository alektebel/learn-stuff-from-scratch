"""Benchmark From Scratch (Mus) — course manifest.

Ten graded stages that build the MEASUREMENT machinery of a benchmark, with the
game provided. The rules are `mus.py` (a Fournier mus table: dealing, the mus
exchange, the four lances with their three bet scales, the 40-point vaca, two
reference policies and a seeded match) — and the exercise is everything that
turns a game into a number: the turn gate that counts what landed, the match loop
with its as-dealt snapshots and its rails, one ground-truth record per decision
taken BEFORE the action, the link between a bet and the answer it got, the
reference distribution a bet is measured against, the risk scorecard where a
bluff is a weak hand and not a lost bet, the low-variance outcome that survives
the vaca reset, the calibration and discrimination probes with their degenerate
cases, the gate that decides what may be published, and the mirrored pair that
cancels the seat advantage.

The lesson of every stage is a mistake the user's own benchmark made and fixed:
a Chica strength read upside down, lances measured on incomparable scales,
per-hand piedras reported without their mirror, a deal stream that depended on
the play, bluffs conflated with lost bets, and an API outage entering the
leaderboard as a result. Each stage's check plants that mistake and names it.

No network, no wall clock, no global state: every match is seeded, every policy
is deterministic, and the numbers are the ones two runs of the same seed produce.
