# codecraft

Your own CodeCrafters, on this repo.

CodeCrafters works because you build a real thing stage by stage and a grader
tells you when each stage is done. This directory is that, local and yours: a
course is a directory of templates plus the tests that define them, and
`codecraft` runs them, remembers how you did, and tunes what it shows you to
how you are actually learning.

It has two jobs, and they are the same job from two sides:

1. **Run any course and coach you through it.** The seven existing projects
   (`llm-from-scratch`, `dynamo-paper`, `context-caching`, `contextcite`,
   `aws-from-scratch`, `deploy-and-debug`, `compiler-and-vgpu`) work
   immediately — it wraps their existing `check.py`.
2. **Let you author new ones.** `codecraft new` scaffolds a course you can fill
   in, so the set of things you can learn grows with your curiosity.

No dependencies. `python3 codecraft/cli.py`, nothing else. There is also a
one-line shim, `cz`, that forwards to the same CLI (`cz run llm-from-scratch`);
see [The `cz` shim](#the-cz-shim) for putting it on your PATH.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
python3 codecraft/cli.py                      # your learning board
python3 codecraft/cli.py path                 # the ordered plan, with live progress
python3 codecraft/cli.py run llm-from-scratch # run it; read the nudge
python3 codecraft/cli.py next                 # just the next action
python3 codecraft/cli.py hint llm-from-scratch# when the nudge is not enough
python3 codecraft/cli.py explain              # ask the NAN mentor what you're getting wrong
python3 codecraft/cli.py ask "why the mask before softmax?"   # or any question
python3 codecraft/cli.py status llm-from-scratch
python3 codecraft/cli.py review               # concepts still unretired
```

A `run` shows the course's own checker output, then three or four coach lines:

```
  codecraft · LLM From Scratch · stage 5  attention.py  — attention weights and the causal mask
  cause   row 1 must differ from the full-attention row — the future leaked
  now     Apply the causal mask as -inf BEFORE the softmax, so each row still
          sums to 1 and position 0 attends only to itself.
  pace    One function at a time; re-run after each.
  predict the output row for position 0 equals V[0].
  stuck? run: python3 codecraft/cli.py hint llm-from-scratch
```

The `cause` is condensed from the checker; `now` is the single micro-action;
`predict` is the number to commit to *before* you run, which is where the
learning actually consolidates.

---

## The `cz` shim

`cz` is a one-line forwarder to `codecraft/cli.py`, for when the full path is
noise:

```bash
cz run aws-from-scratch     # same as python3 codecraft/cli.py run aws-from-scratch
cz path
cz hint aws-from-scratch
```

It lives at the repository root (`./cz`) and is symlinked into `~/.local/bin`,
which your shell already adds to `PATH` via `~/.local/bin/env`. If `cz` is not
found, either use `./cz` from the repository, or add the symlink yourself:

```bash
ln -sf "$PWD/cz" ~/.local/bin/cz
```

Every subcommand of the CLI is available through it; it does nothing else.

---

## The look: milestones and the mentor

Two layers of output, never one. The course's own `check.py` is left untouched —
it is the raw, diagnostic truth. On top of it codecraft adds ceremony and
diagnosis.

**A stage landing gets a banner**, because that is the moment the learning
consolidates:

```
╭────────────────────────────────────╮
│ ✓  Stage 1 passed  —  stage_01.py  │
│    add and contains                │
│    first try — no hints            │
│    █████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░  1/2 │
╰────────────────────────────────────╯
  ✧ ✦ ✶ ✹ ✷
```

Finishing a course gets a bigger one. A regression (a stage that passed and no
longer does) is called out in yellow rather than hidden.

**A failure gets the mentor — immediately.** The rule-based coach can see the
*shape* of your failure but not your code. The mentor can. The moment a stage
fails (or any time you type `explain`) codecraft sends the failing stage's
source, the exact error, and your history to a model on the NAN subscription and
asks for the misconception behind it — before the advice, right after the error:

```
  ✦ mentor  (deepseek-v4-flash)

  misconception  You're treating contains() as a lookup that recalls what you
                 inserted, instead of a test that only ever reads bits.
  the model      contains() is an AND over the positions the item hashes to:
                 all set → maybe present; any unset → definitely absent.
  try this       Before any add, print the bit array and ask which positions
                 _pos returns — can any read 1?
```

It is explicitly **not** a solution generator: the prompt forbids printing the
fix, and if you have failed five times it may describe the algorithm in words
but still not write it. Answers are cached by stage content + error, so a repeat
run is free.

`ask "..."` uses the same context for a free-form question about the current
stage. Both need `NAN_API_KEY` in your environment; codecraft falls back to the
rule-based coach silently when it is absent.

```bash
python3 codecraft/cli.py config --mentor auto     # explain every failure (default)
python3 codecraft/cli.py config --mentor stuck    # only when the history says you're circling
python3 codecraft/cli.py config --mentor manual   # only when you type explain/ask
python3 codecraft/cli.py config --mentor off      # never
python3 codecraft/cli.py config --model glm5.3    # any NAN model id
```

**Privacy:** `explain`/`ask` send the stage source file and the error to
`api.nan.builders` under your own key. Nothing else leaves your machine.
`--mentor off` (or `--no-mentor` on a single run) disables it entirely.

---

## How it adapts

Every run is appended to `history.jsonl`. From that record `codecraft` derives
a model in `profile.json` and classifies the moment you are in:

| Moment | What it saw | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **focused** | first or second attempt, or a fresh `TODO` | minimal nudge: cause, action, prediction |
| **accelerate** | two stages passed on the first try | tells you to move on with hints closed; if it keeps happening, it says the material is below your level and to author something harder |
| **stuck** | three runs, same failure signature | stops you re-running unchanged, gives the smallest experiment, raises the hint level |
| **flailing** | three runs, three *different* failures | tells you to change too much at once and shrink to the smallest case |
| **done** | every stage passes | recommends the next course and queues concepts for review |

Two things make this more than a run counter:

- **Failure signatures.** Each failure text is normalised (numbers, paths and
  quoted values dropped) so the *same* misconception on repeat runs collapses to
  one key, while a genuinely new failure does not. Same failure three times is
  "stuck"; three different failures is "flailing" — very different advice.
- **Concept tags.** Every stage is tagged with the concepts it exercises
  (`boundary`, `numerical-stability`, `masking`, `aliasing`, `quorum-consistency`,
  …). When a tagged stage fails, the tag's mastery box drops. The same tag
  failing in three courses is surfaced as a **habit**, not bad luck:

  ```
  pattern boundary/off-by-one: 4 misses across 3 courses. That is a habit, not a one-off.
  ```

### The hint ladder

Hints escalate only as far as you ask. `hint` raises you one rung and remembers
it for that stage:

```
hint 0  the micro-action for the stage
hint 1  the smallest experiment to run, plus what to predict
hint 2  where the reference solution lives (read it after attempting)
```

Author-specified hints, when a course has them, come first.

### Pacing and style

`python3 codecraft/cli.py config --style deep|balanced|fast`

- **deep** — never auto-reveal; always make you predict; surface review.
- **balanced** — the default above.
- **fast** — accelerate sooner and keep the coach terse.

## Authoring a course

```bash
python3 codecraft/cli.py new bloom-filter --title "Build a Bloom Filter" --stages 3
```

That writes a runnable course. Edit `course.py` — a course *is* its tests:

```python
from codecraft.api import stage

TITLE = "Build a Bloom Filter"
DESCRIPTION = "A probabilistic set, from hashing to false-positive math."

def check_1():
    from stage_01 import BloomFilter
    bf = BloomFilter(bits=64, hashes=2)
    bf.add("x")
    assert "x" in bf
    assert "y" not in bf, "a fresh filter must not report false members"

STAGES = [
    stage(1, file="stage_01.py", title="add and contains",
          tags=["hashing", "data-structure"],
          action="Implement add(): set the k bit positions for the item.",
          predict="Can contains() ever be certain an item is absent?",
          check=check_1),
]
```

Then `python3 codecraft/cli.py run bloom-filter`. Stage files under
`stage_NN.py` raise `NotImplementedError` until you fill them; finished
versions go in `solutions/`.

Write the checks that catch **the mistakes that are easy to make and hard to
notice** — a wrong bit index, a false negative on a fresh filter — not line
coverage. A check whose message names the likely cause is a tutor; the whole
repo is built on that idea, and your courses inherit it.

## Design decisions

- **Wrap, do not patch.** The seven checkers already teach well; editing them to
  emit JSON would risk that and touch seven projects. `contract.py` parses their
  existing output, and authored courses import through `api.py`. One result
  shape either way.
- **A course is its tests.** Authoring a course *is* writing the grader, so the
  scaffold puts metadata and checks in one file, `course.py`, next to the
  templates. There is no separate lesson format to learn.
- **Legible rules over an opaque model.** `adapt.py` is a handful of named
  thresholds you can read and disagree with. An "AI tutor" whose reasoning you
  cannot inspect is hard to trust with your learning.
- **Standard library only.** Same rule as the rest of the repo: if it cannot run
  with `python3`, the lesson gets buried under an install.

## Where this stops

- **It does not grade correctness beyond the checks you (or the project) wrote.**
  A weak check makes a weak course. The quality of the course is the quality of
  its assertions.
- **Review is concept-level, not a full spaced-repetition scheduler.** It
  resurfaces concepts you failed; it does not schedule cards by half-life.
- **No timing analytics yet.** Attempt timestamps are stored, so pace-over-time
  is possible, but nothing reads them yet.
- **It will not write the course for you.** Generating exercises is a different
  tool; this one makes the ones you write adapt to you.
- **The mentor can be wrong.** It sees the failing file and the error, not the
  whole repo or your intent. Treat its diagnosis as a strong hypothesis to test,
  not a verdict — which is why it is asked for an experiment rather than a fix.
  It also needs network access to `api.nan.builders`; the rule-based coach works
  offline.
