"""The path: what to build, in what order, and what is missing.

`codecraft path` renders this merged with your live progress. The order follows
the plan you set — AWS first, then LLM internals, then the AI-engineering half
(RAG, evals, agents, MCP, harness, benchmark, eval), then the systems half
(compiler/GPU/CPU and the rest).

Each item is one of:

  ready     an existing course with a check.py — run it now
  legacy    an existing project with templates and solutions but no checker;
            to use it in codecraft it needs a course.py (see scaffold.py)
  author    a course that does not exist yet; author it with `codecraft new`
  salvage   material exists on another git branch; port it first

`prereq` is the honest dependency, not a suggestion. A course can be started
without its prereqs, but the stages assume them.
