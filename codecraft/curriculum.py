"""Built-in course metadata: what each graded check teaches, and how to unstick.

This is the default curriculum shipped with the existing projects in the repo.
An authored course overrides it entirely with its own `course.py` (see
`scaffold.py`), so this file is only a fallback for directories that carry a
plain `check.py`.

Keyed by (project directory, check index). Titles/files are read from the
checker output at runtime, so this file never has to stay in sync with them —
a missing entry simply degrades gracefully to the checker's own detail.
