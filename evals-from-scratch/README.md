# Evals From Scratch

Build the harness that decides whether a text system got better, in pure
standard-library Python: the split that must not leak, the metrics that are not
about quality, deterministic assertions, EM and F1, ranking metrics, an LLM
judge and its biases, calibration, paired significance, multiple comparisons,
and the gate that runs in CI.

A model that produces text has no `==`. Everything downstream of that — "is
this version better", "did that prompt change help", "can we ship this" — is a
measurement problem, and the measurement is where the bugs are cheap to write
and expensive to notice: a split that leaks, a refusal rate that counts
timeouts, a judge that prefers whichever answer was shown first, a "win" that
is three flipped examples, the best of ten configurations that is significant
only because nobody counted ten. Ten stages, each one a mistake that is easy to
make and hard to see in the numbers.

No API keys, no model downloads, no network. The judge is a callable you pass
in, so the whole harness — including the LLM-judge stage — is synchronous,
offline and reproducible.

## The stages

| # | File | The mechanism | The thing people get wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `stage_01.py` | The eval set, group-wise splits | Splitting rows instead of sources: five phrasings of one ticket land on both sides |
| 2 | `stage_02.py` | Rates, percentiles, token totals | An errored row counted as a refusal; p95 as the mean of the top 5% |
| 3 | `stage_03.py` | Deterministic assertions, three states | `try/except: pass` around the loop, so a broken check reports 100% |
| 4 | `stage_04.py` | Exact match, token F1, corpus vs mean | Normalising the gold only; a set overlap that rewards a repeated word |
| 5 | `stage_05.py` | recall@k, MRR, DCG, nDCG | IDCG computed from the pool that was retrieved, which inflates the worst systems most |
| 6 | `stage_06.py` | The judge, judged twice | One order only: the prompt layout picks the winner |
| 7 | `stage_07.py` | Cohen's kappa, the F1-optimal cut | Reporting agreement. A judge that always says pass agrees with 85% |
| 8 | `stage_08.py` | McNemar, the paired bootstrap | A p-value instead of an interval; an interval that contains zero called a win |
| 9 | `stage_09.py` | Holm's step-down | Ten configs, no correction: the best of ten looks significant 40% of the time |
| 10 | `stage_10.py` | The regression gate and its report | The overall mean, which is exactly the number that hides the broken slice |

Stages 1–5 are the harness, 6–9 are the statistics, 10 is the decision. The
checks exercise the earlier stages (the gate pairs rows by id and bootstraps
with stage 8's machinery), so they are meant to be done in order.

## How to use this directory

```bash
python3 codecraft/cli.py run evals-from-scratch   # what to build next, and why
python3 codecraft/cli.py hint evals-from-scratch  # when a nudge is not enough
```

Or without codecraft:

```bash
python3 -c "import course; [print(i, s.title) for i, s in enumerate(course.STAGES, 1)]"
```

Implement the templates at the top level; finished versions are in `solutions/`.

## Prerequisites

Standard library only: `math`, `random`, `re`, `json`, `collections`. No numpy,
no scipy — `binom_two_sided` is exact integer arithmetic and the bootstrap is a
loop. The ranking metrics overlap with the retrieval courses; the statistics
need nothing beyond knowing what an interval is for. If you have never seen
Cohen's kappa or a bootstrap, stage 7 and 8 are where you meet them, and the
checks are what teach them.

## Design decisions

- **The judge is a function, not a service.** Every judge in this course is a
  callable that takes two answers and returns a side. That is what makes an LLM
  judge's bias measurable with a unit test, and it separates the two questions
  cleanly: is the judge biased (this course) versus is the model good (the
  judge is the only thing that can answer that, and only after stage 7).
- **Count, do not time.** No assertion depends on a wall clock. Where a timing
  would be natural (p95 latency) the check pins the arithmetic — nearest rank,
  the 19th of 20 samples — because a percentile is a request somebody actually
  made, not a smooth curve.
- **Three states, never two.** An assertion that raised is `errored`, not
  `failed` and not `passed`; a gate returns `pass`/`regress`/`inconclusive`. A
  harness that cannot say "I do not know" reports confidence it has not earned.
- **Pin the denominator in every rate.** Refusals over the rows that ran,
  latency over every row including the failures, tokens with a missing field
  counted as zero. Most metric bugs are not in the numerator.
- **Group-wise splits, and the leak is the point.** `split` shuffles groups, so
  near-duplicates cannot straddle the boundary; `overlap` makes the property
  assertable instead of hoped for.
- **Both aggregations of F1, deliberately.** `corpus_f1` pools the counts,
  `mean_f1` averages the per-pair scores, and they disagree (0.80 vs 0.83 on
  the check's fixture). Which one is right depends on whether a row or a token
  is the unit; shipping the wrong one is invisible without both.
- **The ideal ranking is over everything judged, not over what came back.**
  nDCG's denominator is the best ordering of all relevant keys in the
  relevance map. Deriving it from the retrieved pool returns 1.0 for a system
  that retrieved only mediocre documents — the stage's money assertion is
  `ndcg([...]) < 0.5` where the wrong version gives exactly 1.0.
- **Every pair is judged twice.** Position bias is a property of the prompt
  layout, so it is measured, not argued about: the flip rate is the number, and
  a judge with a content preference survives the swap with zero flips — which
  is how the two are told apart.
- **Paired, always paired.** The bootstrap resamples row indices and reads both
  systems at that index. The check measures the interval against the unpaired
  one on the same data and requires it to be strictly narrower, because that is
  the whole reason a few hundred rows can detect a real five-point win.
- **The family is decided before the p-values are read.** Holm's running
  maximum is what makes the adjusted values monotone and what the check pins
  (the fourth and fifth values of the worked example); Bonferroni is strictly
  weaker and is what gets written by accident.
- **A floor is not an average.** A candidate that gains ten points overall and
  drops one tenant below its floor is a regression, and the check's fixture is
  built so the interval itself says the candidate is better — the floor is the
  only thing that can stop it.
- **The report is part of the result.** Reasons, dropped-row counts and 4-decimal
  floats: a gate that returns a bare boolean cannot be reviewed, and a report
  that is not byte-stable makes a CI diff useless.

## Verification

The solutions pass all ten checks, and every check is mutation-tested: 34
plausible wrong implementations — row-wise splits, `load` without a copy, an
uncapped two-sided p-value, McNemar over all rows instead of the discordant
ones, `decide` reading the mean instead of the interval, IDCG from the
retrieved pool, a set overlap in F1, one-order judging, kappa replaced by
agreement, Bonferroni instead of Holm, a step-down that does not stop, a floor
that is ignored, rows paired by position, a report that keeps the raw floats —
are each planted into a solution, and the stage's check must fail. The
assertions that catch them name the mistake in the message, and none of the
checks is allowed to pass on a mutation of the idea it exists to test.

Running a check by hand:

```bash
python3 codecraft/cli.py run evals-from-scratch   # per stage, with the failure line
```

## Where this stops

Deliberately left out, so you know the boundary:

- **No model calls.** The judge is a function, so nothing here measures how good
  a real judge is — the calibration apparatus in stage 7 is what tells you, and
  it needs human labels you have to collect.
- **Fixed-sample statistics.** No sequential testing, no always-valid intervals,
  no early stopping. Those change the p-value you are allowed to quote, and
  they are a separate course.
- **Holm only.** Benjamini-Hochberg's FDR control is the next correction and it
  answers a different question (proportion of false discoveries, not any false
  discovery); the structure of stage 9 is where it would slot in.
- **No online experiment design.** Mirrored traffic, interleaving,
  counterbalancing and the choice of unit of randomisation are the A/B course's
  subject; this one starts from the two runs already collected.
- **Near-duplicate detection is the group key you supply.** `split` keeps a
  declared group together; finding the near-duplicates (minhash, embeddings,
  a template signature) is the retrieval course's problem.
- **Text metrics are lexical.** No embeddings, no learned metrics, no
  semantic similarity — stage 4 is the baseline those have to beat, and the
  reason they need a judge at all.
