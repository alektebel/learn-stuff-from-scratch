"""Evals From Scratch — course manifest.

Ten graded stages that build an evaluation harness for text-output systems and
the statistics that decide whether a difference is real: the split that must
not leak, the metrics that are not about quality, deterministic assertions, EM
and F1, ranking metrics, a judge and its biases, calibration, paired
significance, multiple comparisons, and the gate you put in CI.
