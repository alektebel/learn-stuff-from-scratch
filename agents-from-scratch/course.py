"""Agents From Scratch — course manifest.

Ten graded stages that build an agent runtime from the parts up, with the model
injected as a plain callable so every run is deterministic and offline: the loop
and the transcript that is the state, tool schemas and argument validation, a
toolbox where a failure is an observation, parsing what the model actually said,
retries and the effect that must not happen twice, memory bounded by turns, a
sandbox the tools cannot leave, an approval gate against content that is not a
command, budgets that stop a run without overshooting it, and the trace and the
audit that read the world instead of the story.
