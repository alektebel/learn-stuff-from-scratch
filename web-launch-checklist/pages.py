"""
The site's pages, as HTML.

DESIGN DECISION - why a Python module instead of a `site/` directory of `.html`
files. The plan in the module README says "build a `site/` directory served by
`serve.py`". The mutation harness (`_build/mutations.py` through
`.claude/skills/graded-module/scripts/mutate.py`) builds its sandbox by copying
`check.py` plus every `solutions/*.py` into a temporary directory; a directory of
HTML never travels with it, so planted bugs in the pages would be unreachable and
the checks would grade a stale copy. Keeping the page HTML in one importable
module makes the copy complete and the bugs testable. The alternative - a static
directory plus a manual before/after for every page mutation - hides two of the
three exercises from the mutation test. The cost: the learner edits Python string
literals instead of `.html` files. The HTML inside them is still real HTML, and
the observer still crawls it over HTTP.

DESIGN DECISION - one `_doc` helper, `NAV` shared. Every page carries the same
navigation, so the crawler can discover the whole site from the home page alone.
If a page were only reachable from `sitemap.xml` the link graph would miss it; the
sitemap is a later exercise and must not be what makes a page findable.
