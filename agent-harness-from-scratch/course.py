"""Agent Harness From Scratch — course manifest.

Ten graded stages that build the runtime UNDER an agent, with the model as a
callable: the event stream one model call returns and its single reduction into a
turn, a prompt budget recomputed from the bytes rather than trusted to a
tokenizer, the loop whose exhaustion is an outcome and not an exception, dispatch
where an unknown tool is a message the model can read and repair, streaming with
the arrival timings of a turn, retries that stop the moment anything has been
forwarded, compaction that summarizes the middle while pinning the system message
and never orphaning an observation, the trace that keeps the shape of a run and
none of its payloads, the process reward that makes every step earn its place by
citing the result before it, and the verifier plus the self-generated data loop
whose accuracy is measured where the agent has not been.

The domain is provided (`tiny_env.py`: three tables, a scripted model, a manual
clock, four analytic tasks and the question templates). The harness is the
exercise: no network, no sockets, no wall clock — every model is scripted and
every backoff waits on a clock the test moves by hand.
