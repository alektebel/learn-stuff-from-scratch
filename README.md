# learn-stuff-from-scratch

A collection of from-scratch implementations of various systems and projects for learning purposes.

**New here? Read [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md)** — what this repo is for, and the three
principles every directory follows: design choices named as problem-solving decisions,
MVP-then-complicate driven by limit cases, and verification you can run.

## codecraft — the adaptive course runner

**[codecraft/](codecraft/)** turns this repo into your own CodeCrafters. It runs any
course's `check.py`, remembers every attempt, classifies how you got stuck (the same
failure three times vs. three different failures get different advice), and tunes the
nudge, hint depth and pacing to you. It also scaffolds **new** from-scratch courses you
author yourself:

```bash
cz run llm-from-scratch       # run a course, get coached (cz = the CLI shim)
cz path                       # the ordered plan, with progress
python3 codecraft/cli.py new my-course --title "Build X" --stages 3
```

`cz` is a one-line forwarder to `python3 codecraft/cli.py`; both work. See
[codecraft/README.md](codecraft/README.md).

- **[vector-index-from-scratch/](vector-index-from-scratch/)** - Approximate nearest-neighbour search, measured against the exact answer: brute force with a work counter, the metric and its norm cache, k-means, IVF with `nprobe`, HNSW built and walked, deletions by tombstone, int8 quantization, and the recall/latency frontier with the tuning held out (10 graded checks via `python3 codecraft/cli.py run vector-index-from-scratch`)
- **[evals-from-scratch/](evals-from-scratch/)** - The harness that decides whether a text system got better: group-wise splits, operational rates and percentiles, deterministic assertions with three states, EM and token F1, recall@k/MRR/nDCG, an LLM judge judged in both orders, Cohen's kappa and the F1-optimal threshold, McNemar and the paired bootstrap, Holm's correction, and a regression gate with per-slice floors (10 graded checks via `python3 codecraft/cli.py run evals-from-scratch`)
- **[agents-from-scratch/](agents-from-scratch/)** - The runtime under an agent, with the model injected as a callable so every run is deterministic and offline: the tool loop and the transcript that is its state, tool schemas and argument validation, a toolbox that turns a failure into an observation, parsing what a model actually writes, retries with an injected clock and effects that cannot land twice, memory bounded by turns, a filesystem sandbox that resolves before it compares, an approval gate against content that is not a command, budgets that stop before the call that would exceed them, and a trace plus a state-based audit (10 graded checks via `python3 codecraft/cli.py run agents-from-scratch`)
- **[mcp-from-scratch/](mcp-from-scratch/)** - A Model Context Protocol server from the bytes up (spec revision 2025-06-18, standard library only, no sockets): the JSON-RPC envelope and its error codes, stdio/SSE/HTTP framing with stdout purity, the lifecycle handshake with derived capabilities, tools and the protocol-versus-execution error split, resources and prompt templates including the one "not found" the spec pins at -32002, subscriptions/progress/cancellation where a cancelled request gets no response at all, read-only first with an allowlisted report tool, idempotency keys for a caller that retries, a confirmation dialog that shows the diff it is about to apply, and the trajectory policy plus an audit line with no clock and no payload (10 graded checks via `python3 codecraft/cli.py run mcp-from-scratch`)
- **[agent-harness-from-scratch/](agent-harness-from-scratch/)** - The runtime under an agent, with the model as a callable returning an event stream (standard library only, no network, no wall clock): collect a turn from text/tool_call/usage/end events, a prompt budget recomputed from the bytes, the loop where a spent budget is an outcome instead of an exception, dispatch where an unknown tool or a bad argument is an observation the model can repair, streaming with TTFT and inter-token timings, retries that stop the moment anything was forwarded, compaction by turn that summarizes the middle and pins the system message, a trace of exactly six keys and no payloads, a process reward that grounds every step in the result before it, and a verifier plus a self-generated data loop whose accuracy is measured on held-out tasks (10 graded checks via `python3 codecraft/cli.py run agent-harness-from-scratch`)
- **[benchmark-from-scratch/](benchmark-from-scratch/)** - The measurement machinery of a benchmark on top of a provided Fournier mus engine (standard library only, no network, no wall clock): gate an action so a refusal is data and not a turn, run a match with as-dealt snapshots, an engine-supplied fallback and the rails that stop a run that became about the harness, record one ground-truth decision per turn from the position the seat actually faced, link an aggression to the answer it got, tercile the strength of the hands that could bet, score aggression, bluffs and fold equity, reduce a match to piedras that survive the vaca reset, probe a declared probability with Brier, log-loss, AUC and a calibration table, gate what may be published, and play every matchup twice under one seed so the seat advantage cancels.
- **[eval-framework-from-scratch/](eval-framework-from-scratch/)** - The runner under an eval, with the task set, the actors and the clock provided (standard library only, no network, no wall clock): validate a suite config and hash its effective form, resolve metric plugins before the first call, run one case per record with an error taxonomy that blames the right side, check call and clock budgets before the call instead of reporting them after, aggregate by case with the weights the suite declared, ask a judge through a cached and budgeted session that survives a position bias, write records whose bytes two runs share, gate a run with exit codes that order an invalid run before a failed gate, diff a candidate against a baseline through the noise of both, and resume a killed run into the exact bytes of an uninterrupted one.

### System Design & Distributed Systems
- **[system-design/](system-design/)** - Core distributed systems patterns: caching (LRU, cache-aside, stampede), async queues (retries, backoff, DLQ, idempotency), reliability (circuit breaker, bulkhead, backpressure), consistent hashing, leaderboards, URL shortener, rate limiter, and capacity math
- **[dynamo-paper/](dynamo-paper/)** - Amazon's Dynamo paper (SOSP 2007) implemented directly: consistent hashing with preference lists, vector clocks, N/R/W quorums, sloppy quorum with hinted handoff, Merkle-tree anti-entropy, and gossip membership (17 graded checks via `python3 check.py`)
- **[aws-from-scratch/](aws-from-scratch/)** - Learn AWS by implementing toy versions of its core services: IAM policy evaluation, S3 with versioning and delete markers, SQS visibility timeouts, DynamoDB hot partitions, Lambda concurrency and cold starts, SNS filter policies and EventBridge patterns, KMS envelope encryption, VPC stateful-vs-stateless networking, plus a capstone pipeline wiring them together - and a map of which remaining AWS services are variations of which mechanism (18 graded checks via `python3 check.py`)

## Philosophy

This repository is dedicated to learning by building things from scratch. Each directory contains:
- **Template files** with TODO comments and implementation guidelines
- **Step-by-step instructions** for gradual implementation
- **Complete solutions** in the `solutions/` folder for reference
- A clear learning path from basics to advanced topics

## Structure

Each project directory contains:

```
project-name/
├── README.md              # Project overview and learning path
├── template-files         # Empty templates with TODOs and guidelines
├── Makefile              # Build configuration (for C projects)
└── solutions/            # Complete working implementations
    ├── README.md         # Solution documentation
    └── solution-files    # Fully implemented code
```

## Getting Started

1. **Choose a project** that interests you
2. **Read the README** in that directory to understand the goals
3. **Start with the template files** - they have TODOs and guidelines
4. **Implement gradually** - follow the TODO comments step by step
5. **Test frequently** - build and test as you implement each section
6. **Check solutions** when stuck or to verify your approach
7. **Learn and iterate** - understand each step before moving forward

## Implementation Approach

The templates are designed to be:
- ✅ **Gradual**: Start simple, add complexity incrementally
- ✅ **Guided**: Clear TODO comments explain what to implement
- ✅ **Balanced**: Not too easy (no hand-holding), not too hard (reasonable steps)
- ✅ **Educational**: Focus on understanding concepts, not just copying code

## Building Projects

Most C projects include a Makefile:

```bash
cd project-name/
make          # Build the project
make run      # Run the program
make test     # Run tests (if available)
make clean    # Clean build artifacts
```
