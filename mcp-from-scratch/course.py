"""MCP From Scratch — course manifest.

Ten graded stages that build an MCP server from the bytes up: the JSON-RPC
envelope and the four ways to answer it, the transports that frame it (a stdio
line, an SSE event, an HTTP POST), the handshake that negotiates a revision and a
capability table that cannot lie, tools whose arguments are validated and whose
errors are split into protocol and execution, resources and prompt templates
(including the one "not found" the spec pins), out-of-band messages where a
cancelled request gets no answer at all, read-only-first tool design with the
allowlisted report in the middle, idempotency keys for a caller that retries, a
confirmation dialog that shows the diff it is about to apply, and the trajectory
policy plus the audit line that has no clock and no payload.

The domain is provided (`erp.py`); the protocol is the exercise. No sockets, no
network, no wall clock: every transport reads and writes in-memory streams, so a
test can hand the server bytes and read what came back.
